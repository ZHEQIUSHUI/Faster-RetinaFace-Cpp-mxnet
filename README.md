# Faster-RetinaFace-Cpp-mxnet
this repositories retinaface is faster than my [the other repositories](https://github.com/ZHEQIUSHUI/Retinaface-Cpp-mxnet),and faster than Official demo!!

# Special mention!!!
[RetinaFace-Cpp-caffe-version](https://github.com/Charrin/RetinaFace-Cpp):this programing is the best with retinaface code by cpp

[dwjlw1314](https://github.com/dwjlw1314):the main code have change to mxnet was provide by this brother.thank!

## Model from deepinsight/insightface/RetinaFace

[deepinsight](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/RetinaFace):

Pretrained Model: RetinaFace-R50 ([baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1C6nKq122gJxRhb37vK0_LQ) or [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/53ftnlarhyrpkg2/retinaface-R50.zip?dl=0)) is a medium size model with ResNet50 backbone.
It can output face bounding boxes and five facial landmarks in a single forward pass.

WiderFace validation mAP: Easy 96.5, Medium 95.6, Hard 90.4. 

To avoid the confliction with the WiderFace Challenge (ICCV 2019), we postpone the release time of our best model.
